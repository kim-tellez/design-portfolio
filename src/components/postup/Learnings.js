                        Having only five days to complete a deliverable seemed overwhelming at first. 
                        However, I followed the guidelines set forth by GV Design Sprints and found that solutions already 
                        existed for the problem I needed to solve - it was just a matter of picking the right ones and 
                        making them relevant to our users.</li><br />
                        <li><b>Bainstorming alone is not ideal, but it is possible. </b>
                        Throughout this process, I had to find ways to make sure that I was considering several ideas 
                        instead of just running with my first idea. 
                        Early on, I did this by annotating my ideas with areas for improvement and re-iterating and 
                        by doing Crazy 8 sketches. </li><br />
                        <li><b>Selecting the right tools for the job gets you half-way there. </b> 
                        For this design, I wanted to focus on the functionality of my solution 
                        instead of on the visual aesthetics. 
                        That is why I chose to use UI Elements and Icons from Material Design, 
                        and this helped tremendously while creating the prototype. 
                        However, I wish I had tested my solution differently with users, as some of the usability issues 
                        that I found may have come about due to my chosen method for the remote test.</li>
